due to I can't volume the neccessary data in ./docker directory
I'm using the clickhouse server from docker compose

Step to deploy these services

step 1: start the clickhouse using docker-compose
docker-compose up clickhouse -d 


step 2: run this list of commands in list-of-service.txt file


step 3: adjust all hostnames available in web-deployment.yaml to connect "web" service with other services


step 4: re-deploy the "web" service
kubectl apply -f web-deployment.yaml
